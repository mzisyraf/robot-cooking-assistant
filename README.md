# Robot Cooking Assistant
## Introduction
This is a project done for WID3010 Autonomous Robotics session 2023/2024 where we aim to help those struggling with thinking of what to cook with the ingredients at hand using the help of robot vision and speech. This project was completed using Jupiter Robot Juno and the ROS framework. What are the core modules of the project?

- Object Detection: To detect the ingredients available
- OpenAI Inferencing: Use OpenAI API to prompt the list of ingredients to obtain 5 dishes that can be cooked
- Text-to-Speech: Produces a speech output of the dishes that can be cooked
